
	The first line of the input is an integer "test_case" that represents the number of test cases. Each subsequent line contains a string "p" consisting of digits ('0'-'9') or question marks ('?'). The question marks can be replaced by any digit from '0' to '9'. The length of "p" is at most 100.

	For each test case, the program calculates the number of possible strings that can match "p". Specifically, it counts the number of question marks in "p" and multiplies it by 9 if the first character of "p" is a question mark, or by 10 otherwise. The reason for this is that the first character cannot be zero, and there are nine possible digits for a question mark in the first position, while there are ten possible digits for any other position.

	If the first character of "p" is '0', the program outputs 0 and exits. Otherwise, it outputs the number of possible strings for the current test case.

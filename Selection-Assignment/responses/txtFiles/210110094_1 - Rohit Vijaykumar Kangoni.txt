The solution to the problem statement is quite straightforward,it uses our logic from PnC to find the number of possible numbers such that xyz conditons:

If first character is a ? it can be filled with 1-9 so m=9
If the first character is a zero it does not fit into the valid criteria and hence m=0 

A question mark at any other location can be filled with 0-9 so m=m*10
Characters that are not a ? then m=m*1 as the box is fixed

The output is stored in an array of lenght being the first input ie the number of testcases.

The problem statement is to tell how many permutations can be formed for a positive (strictly greater than 0) integer in particular integer template.
Therefore, we analyze the string consisting of digits and/or question marks.We don't want any leading zeroes for the integer template.

So,at the start we take input for test cases from the user,then we use for loop to check required solution for every test case.then we define digplace which can be used for answer calculation. Then we take the num input of the string and check it's length. Then with help of it's length we analyze it's each character and use proper conditions . 
First we check if the string has any leading zero,if it has then we print 0, then if it doesn't have any leading zero we use for loop to check that the particular character of string is a digit or ? character. If it has a digit so we use continue function as we can't change it . If it is a ? character ,we check that is it the leading character or not as we can't put "0" in it ,thus if it is the leading character then we can do 9 permutations of digits from "1 to 9" ,if it's not leading character then we can do 10 "0 to 9" digits. we multiply it to the value of digplace accordingly.
Then we print answer for every test case after doing every calculation for any particular number and the loop continues till all test cases are finished and we get our desired output.

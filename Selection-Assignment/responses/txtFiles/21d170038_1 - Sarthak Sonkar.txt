First define two integers, here n and j. Then as you input n, run a while loop which should run for n loop. In the while loop define integer output equal to 1. Then in the loop use for loop in which use above defined int j and make the for loop run until its value is less than n. Create a string, here x. Define if command for x and update the corresponding output. Then print output.

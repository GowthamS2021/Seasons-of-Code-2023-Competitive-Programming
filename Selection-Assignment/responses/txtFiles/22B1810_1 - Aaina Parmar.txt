Approach for Problem 1
Firstly, I prompted the user for an integer template. Then I started a for-loop for integers from 1 to 99999. For every integer, I first separated the digits and then stored them in an array called ‘digits[ ]’. I also calculated the size of the integer (number of digits) in the same while loop. It is clear in the question that the integer must have the same number of digits as the template so I put an if loop in which the condition was that ‘size=length of template string’. If this condition is true, then I compared all the digits of the integer with the string individually. If all the digits are either equal to the corresponding digit of the string or that element of the string is a ‘?’ then, that number matches the template. So I increase the counter by 1 each time and finally this counter gives us the number of integers.

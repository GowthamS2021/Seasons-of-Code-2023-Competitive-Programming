# Candies

This problem is about candy. Initially, you only have 1 candy, and you want to have exactly n candies.

You can use the two following spells in any order at most 40  times in total.

- Assume you have x candies now. If you use the first spell, then x candies become 2x-1 candies.
- Assume you have x candies now. If you use the second spell, then x candies become 2x+1 candies.

Construct a sequence of spells, such that after using them in order, you will have exactly n candies, or determine it's impossible.

# Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t ( any number between 1 and 10000) — the number of test cases. Their description follows. 

Each test case contains one line with a single integer n (any number between 2 and $10^9$) — the required final number of candies.

# Output
For each test case, output the following.

If it's possible to eventually have n candies within 40 spells, in the first line print an integer m (any number between 1 and 40), representing the total number of spells you use.

In the second print m integers $a_1,a_2,a_3...,a_m$ ($a_i$ is 1 or 2) separated by spaces, where $a_i$=1 means that you use the first spell in the i-th step, while $a_i$=2 means that you use the second spell in the i-th step.

Note that you do not have to minimize m, and if there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

If it's impossible, output −1 in one line.

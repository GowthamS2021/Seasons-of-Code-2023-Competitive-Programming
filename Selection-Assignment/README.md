# Assignment for Selection

Hey!, This time we had overwhelming response to the project. Thanks! 

So, We had to test people on their existing C++ programming skills. 

Here are the rules: 
1. There are 2 questions in this directory of the github repository. You are supposed to solve **any one** of them using C++ in order for us to select you. 
2. You are supposed to submit 2 files regarding the question that you had solved:
    -  One is **code-file** in the following naming format `<rollnumber>_<No>.cpp`
        where <rollnumber> is supposed to be your name (*one* word please !) and the <no> is the problem number . That is 
        - 1 for Matching
        - 2 for Candies
        
        For example, If your roll number is 210050059 and you have solved problem 2, submit the code file with the name `210050059_2.cpp`
    - Two is a small paragraph in `.txt` file on what method you have used. It is completely fine if you able to express what you have written in single line. We just wanted to know whether you got the idea of the question. Naming format of the txt-file is same as for the code file but the extension would be .txt. for the above example, It will be `210050059_2.txt`. 
3. The rule-2 is just to ensure that we can identify each one's code uniquely. 
4. You will have to submit the document from your computer into the [google form](https://forms.gle/rtrp1Np3ujLUZtur7).
 
So, Move on !. We know that exams are going on, so we have chosen questions in such a way that it won't take you much time to solve (At max 10-15 mins). Note that these questions **don't** require any knowledge of CP.
